## Example projects related to current research interests

### SCORE Network

[SCORE](https://scorenetwork.org/index.html){target="_blank"} is a national network for developing and disseminating Sports Content for Outreach, Research, and Education in data science, funded by the National Science Foundation.

My role in the project is as a research student working on creating data modules for professors to use based on different sports of my choosing. 
Examples of our work can be found at the following:

- [https://modules.scorenetwork.org/](https://modules.scorenetwork.org/){target="_blank"}: contains the completed modules produced across all of SCORE.
    
- [https://data.scorenetwork.org/](https://data.scorenetwork.org/){target="_blank"}: A data repository containing sports related datasets.

- [https://iramler.github.io/slu_score_preprints/](https://iramler.github.io/slu_score_preprints/){target="_blank"}: A repository of in-development modules produced by St. Lawrence University students and faculty. Many of the modules linked here are currently under review for inclusion in the SCORE Network's repository linked above.
