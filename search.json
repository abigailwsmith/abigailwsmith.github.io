    "text": "I am a rising junior at St. Lawrence University with a double major in data science and history. I am a member of the Women’s Varsity Crew team at St. Lawrence. I enjoy studying sports statistics, in particular baseball, but I enjoy studying all sports. This summer (2024) I had the amazing experience working on the SCORE Network Research Fellowship at St. Lawrence. I look forward to exploring more data science in the upcoming school year (2024-25)."
