title: "About Me"
---

I am a rising junior at St. Lawrence University with a double major in data science and history. I am a member of the Women's Varsity Crew team at St. Lawrence. I enjoy studying sports statistics, in particular baseball, but I enjoy studying all sports. This summer (2024) I had the amazing experience working on the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org/){target="_blank"} Research Fellowship at St. Lawrence. I look forward to exploring more data science in the upcoming school year (2024-25).
